The implementation of the background subtraction algorithm is borroed heavily from this related 
[medium post](https://hackernoon.com/raspberrypi-home-surveillance-with-only-150-lines-of-python-code-2701bd0373c9).

# Installation to a new Raspberry2 B+

## Install necessary libraries 
- ```sudo apt-get update```
- ```sudo apt-get install build-essential python2.7-dev python-setuptools```
- ```sudo su```
- ```sh install_opencv.sh``` 
- ```sudo easy_install pip```
- ```sudo pip install picamera```

## Setup config files
- Set email address to be used by the agent. It is in the source code.
- Set your email address to be noticed for each alert

## Run the agent
- ```python server.py ```
- Go to given URL on the terminal
- Activate or deactivate the agent. The idea here, if you are close to your house, your phone will connect to your net before you enter the house, 
then you can deactivate the agent to prevent wrong alert on you. You should also activate it before leaving the house. ItÄºl give you some time to 
leave the house then become active.
